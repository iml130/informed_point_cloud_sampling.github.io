            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p> Robotic manipulation in dynamic environments
presents significant challenges, especially compared to the
adaptability and flexibility of humans. While traditional robotic
systems excel in controlled settings, their performance falters
in unpredictable scenarios. Learning-based control has shown
promise in addressing these challenges by developing adaptable
behaviors for robotic platforms. However, its application to real-
world manipulation tasks remains limited. This paper presents
a two-stage training process to improve the robustness of
robotic grasping tasks in dynamic environments. In particular,
we introduce new rewards and observations of net contact
measurements for more effective teacher training. Moreover, we
utilize privileged information to inform point cloud sampling,
enhancing student training and sim-to-real transfer reliability.
Our framework is validated through ablation studies and real-
world experiments, demonstrating robust grasping of various
objects under a variety of changing environmental conditions.
These advancements contribute to bridging the sim-to-real gap,
paving the way for generalizable and deployable manipulation
policies that function independently of specific settings.</p>

            <h2>Method</h2>
 	    <figcaption>Overview of the Teacher-Student training process. First, we train a teacher policy on privileged information using Reinforcement Learning. After the policy achieves a sufficient success rate, we use the teacher in an imitation learning
process to generate target actions, that the student imitates. Additionally, the student estimates the current distance between
the grasp position and the object center. We use this estimation for the informed sampling process, which generates an
object-centric point cloud, which we merge with a synthetic point cloud representing the robot.</figcaption>

	    <br>
	    
	    Here as a visuell example we show the common way of uniformely sampling and our informed sampling-method from a point cloud. We only use the object estimation output generated by the policy to set the object center and sample the point cloud using our proposed method. The policy is able to track the object on the table

	    <h2> Experiments </h2>
	    To evaluate the proposed methods, we perform an ablation study to assess the extension to the baseline in simulation. Further, we evaluate the efficiency of the proposed point cloud sampling method. In real-world experiments, we investigate the trained policies in terms of grasping success and robustness to deviations, such as different scenes, perturbations, and camera positions.	
            <h3>Grasping Experiments</h3>

	    The grasping experiments we conducted of all twelve objects.

            <h3>Invariance to Changes in the Scene</h3>

	    In this experiment we perform two grasps of a mug, then change the camera and move the surface, from which we grasp the object.
	    Then we perform two more grasp and change the camera and desk again, to perform two final grasps. This shows, that our method works without any strong synchronization of simulated scene and reality.

	    <h3>Different Scene and Camera Angle</h3>
	    We turn the desk, that the robot is situated on towards another surface, that is strongly out-of-distribution from the environment, that we trained the policy in. Furthermore, the camera angle and the robot pose is also not included in simulation training. However, by leveraging informed point cloud sampling and the sim-to-real methods we propose, the policy still has some success in grasping objects.

	    <h3>Grasping with Distractors</h3>
	    We test the method on performing in scenes with different objects. If there is a big difference between the object to be grasped and the distractors, the policy can easily choose to grasp the right object thanks to informed sampling.

	     <h3>Failures</h3>
	    <br>
	    Here, we depict some failures of the system. To be precise, grasps where the system took especially long to perform the task or where a human had to intervene. The most common failure case is slightly failing in the grasp due to precision and then repeating this behavior over and over again. Sometimes the system also fails in estimating the state correctly resulting in an orientation that doesn't allow a successful grasp.
